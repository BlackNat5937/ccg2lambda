# ccg2lambda VISUALIZE : composing semantic representations guided by CCG derivations

This is a tool to derive formal semantic representations of natural language sentences given CCG derivation trees and semantic templates.

## Installation

Download and install ccg2lambda first : https://github.com/mynlp/ccg2lambda

Launch the visualization.jar

## Using the software

### If it is the first time :

You will need to indicate the path to the ccg2lambda directory

### All the time :

Chose the templates you want by selecting the templates in the menu bar. Then, enter the sentences you want (enter then add), you can delete sentences (right click on the sentence, then Delete the sentence).

When you have your sentences, click on the button Visualize. You can see your results in different type. To change the visualization type, click on the tab corresponding. You can select the sentences you want by clicking on it's formula in the bottom Formula tab.
